                            <p>The main goal for making laws of safety and security in the company <br> is to prevent accidents resulting from failure or neglect by any workman, <br> which may lead to big losses of life or property and disrupts the wheel of production <br> and its quality. <br> <br> This goal can’t be achieved without the concerted efforts of both management and staff,<br> and working together so that both of them bear the responsibility to participate <br> in the implementation of plans and safety programs at work. <br> And that makes the company management able to achieve the following goals :  <br>  <br> 1 – Create a safe environment - suitable for work. <br> 2 - Ensure the efficiency and validity of the company & apos;s machinery and equipment. <br> 3 - Use and qualifying active staffs continuously, <br> <br> and these goals can’t be achieved without distributing responsibilities <br> and duties among all the employees. <br> Safety is a great analogy for understanding quality. <br> Everything safety is about relates to the absolutes of quality management. <br> Quality management is a systematic way of guaranteeing that organized activities happen the way they are planned. <br> It is a management discipline concerned with preventing problems from occurring by creating the attitudes and controls that make prevention possible.</p>
